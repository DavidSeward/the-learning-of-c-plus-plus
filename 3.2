* This file is my answer to question 3.2 of the Open CourseWare course found at the following link:                                                     *

*                                                                                                                                                       *
* The question is as follows:                                                                                                                           *
* 3.2 Basic Statistics                                                                                                                                  *
* Given a list of N integers, find it's mean (as a double), maximum value, minimum value, and range. Your program will first ask for N, the number of   *
* integers in the list, which the user will input. Then the user will input N more numbers.                                                             *
*                                                                                                                                                       *
* Example:                                                                                                                                              *
* N = 3                                                                                                                                                 *
* I1 = 2                                                                                                                                                *
* I2 = 1                                                                                                                                                *
* I3 = 3                                                                                                                                                *
*                                                                                                                                                       *
* In essence, three numbers are given: 2, 1, and 3. The output should look like this:                                                                   *
* Mean:  2                                                                                                                                              *
* Max:   3                                                                                                                                              *
* Min:   1                                                                                                                                              *
* Range: 2                                                                                                                                              *
*                                                                                                                                                       *
* Besides the mean being declared as a double, the rest works as advertised. It was all written by me, David Seward with only some minor Googling.      *
*                                                                                                                                                       *
